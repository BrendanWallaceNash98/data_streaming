# Data Streaming System

This project was a chance to work with many in a more cohesive manner. I have worked with Airflow, Cassandra and Spark before but all as individaul 
tools but never in a full pipeline. Kafka it a tool that I have been looking to use for a while so intergrating it as the message broker between Airflow and Spark 
was a good opportunity to get hands on experience with it. 

I used the Ramsom User API that has an endpoint that allows you to request PII data of fake people generated by AI. While it does not allw for the request that would be 
needed for a system of this scale, it is a reliable and generous in its quaota.
